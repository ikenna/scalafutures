## Specifying Callbacks on Futures

A Future can either

* execute successfully. In this case the Future completes with a result wrapped by an object of type `scala.util.Success` (which is a subtype of `scala.util.Try`)

or

* throw an exception.  In this case the Future completes with a result wrapped by an object of type `scala.util.Failure` (also a subtype of `scala.util.Try`)


There are 3 callbacks you can specify on Futures and Promises

1. `onSuccess` : what should happen if Future completes successfully

2. `onFailure` : what should happen if Future completes with a Failure

3. `onComplete` : the success and failure behaviours (a combination of the above 2)

Here is an example below to demonstrate onSuccess and onFailure ( [or view the src file](https://github.com/ikenna/scalafutures/blob/master/main/test/ikenna/futuresnotes/OnSuccess_and_OnFailure_Callbacks.scala) )

```
package ikenna.futuresnotes

import scala.concurrent._
import java.util.concurrent.Executors

object OnSuccess_and_OnFailure_Callbacks {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    implicit val executionContext = ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(Executors.newCachedThreadPool())

    val aFuture:Future[String] =  future{"Hello World!"} // change this to 'future{throw new RuntimeException()}' later and see what happens

    aFuture onSuccess  {
      case result => println(s"onSuccess : $result")
    }

    aFuture onFailure   {
      case exception:Throwable => println(s"onFailure : $exception")
    }
  }

  /** Output:
   * onSuccess : Hello World!
   */
}


```

Note that in the above example we create our own ExecutionContext using `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()` (line 9),  instead of importing the `ExecutionContext.Implicits.global` as we did in previous examples. (See footnote 1)

The below example shows use of the OnComplete callback ( [or view the src file](https://github.com/ikenna/scalafutures/blob/master/main/test/ikenna/futuresnotes/OnComplete_Callback.scala) )

```
package ikenna.futuresnotes

import scala.concurrent._
import scala.util.Failure
import scala.util.Success
import java.util.concurrent.Executors

object OnComplete_Callback {

  def main(args: Array[String]) {
    implicit val executionContext = ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService(Executors.newCachedThreadPool())

    val aFuture: Future[String] = future {"Hello World!"}

    aFuture onComplete {
      case Success(result) => println(s"onComplete success: $result")
      case Failure(result) => println(s"onComplete failure: $result")
    }
  }

  /**Output:
   * onComplete success: Hello World!
   */
}


```

Callbacks are one big difference Scala Futures have from Java Futures. Lets look at this in the next section.

## Footnote
1. The ExecutionContext.Implicits.global context we would normally import creates an ExecutionContext that uses a ForkJoinFramework.
By default, this ForkJoinFrameWork runs Futures in a daemon Thread (1). Now the JVM will not shutdown if a normal thread is running, but it can shutdown if a daemon thread is still running (2).
If we used the ExecutionContext.Implicits.global, it would run our Futures code in a daemon thread and in our example, the JVM  can exit before the Future completes.
To prevent this, we create our own ExecutionContext from a ThreadPoolExecutor, that runs the Future normal (non-daemon) threads.
