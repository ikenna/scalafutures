#Introduction to Scala Futures and Promises
(Part 1)

## What is a Future ?

* A Future is a reference to the result of an asynchronous computation [1]. Its an object that keeps track of a concurrent computation, and can provide the result of the computation when it is complete [2].

* When would you use a Future ? If you had several computations you would like to run in parallel, and access their results  at a later point. Using futures can improve performance.

* Note: The Future is asynchronous because its computation is running in a different thread.


## What is a Promise

* A Promise is a single assignment reference that can be used to complete its associated Future. [1]

* Creating a Promise creates its associated Future. Completing a Promise completes its associated Future.

* You can write to a Promise only once. But you can read its result as many times as you like.

* When would you use a Promise ? You can use a Promise to pass messages between Futures. If this is confusing, don't worry - we will explain it more later with an example
