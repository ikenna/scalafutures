* A Future is a reference to the result of an asynchronous computation. In other words, a placeholder for a value that will be available at some point in future, as a result of some concurrent computation.

2. [Creating Futures](https://github.com/ikenna/scalafutures/blob/master/docs/2_Creating_Futures.md)
3. [Accessing the result of a Future by blocking](https://github.com/ikenna/scalafutures/blob/master/docs/3_Accessing_The_Result_Of_A_Future_By_Blocking.md)
4. [Specifying Callbacks on Futures](https://github.com/ikenna/scalafutures/blob/master/docs/4_Callbacks_on_futures.md)
5. [Comparing Java and Scala Futures](5_Comparing_java_and_scala_futures.md)

You can fork this repository and play with the example code. If you have sbt installed, running `sbt gen-idea` in the project directory with generate the intelliJ project for it.
